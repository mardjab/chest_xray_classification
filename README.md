# Chest X-ray classification

## Overview

In the medical field, one of the most promising areas of innovation is the application of machine learning in medical imaging.

Chest X ray images currently are the most realiable method for diagnosing lung diseases.

In this project, a large set of chest X-ray images will be used to build a model that detects and classifies lungs infected with tuberculosis, pneumonia or COVID-19.

## Goals

To build a model that can be used to detect and classify human pulmonary diseases from chest x-ray images
